Introduction:
Healthcare data analysis is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare systems. By leveraging data-driven insights, healthcare professionals 
can enhance patient care, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions. This project aims to explore and analyze healthcare data 
to extract valuable information that can contribute to improvements in healthcare delivery.

Dataset:
The dataset was obtained from kaggle and it contains information on medical conditions, medications, admissions, and other relevant healthcare parameters. 
It is essential to understand the structure and content of the dataset before proceeding with the analysis.

Analysis Goals:
Identify prevalent medical conditions within the dataset.
Explore medication usage patterns for different medical conditions.
Analyze admission trends to understand peak admission days.
Derive insights into the relationships between medical conditions, medications, and admissions.
Methods:
The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, statistical analysis, and data visualization. 
Python programming language and relevant libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, are employed for data manipulation and visualization.

Files:
healthcare_data.csv: The raw dataset used for analysis.
healthcare_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the data analysis.
Dependencies:
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Setup and Execution:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook healthcare_analysis.ipynb.
Results:
The analysis results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook. Visualizations, key findings, and insights derived from the data are documented.

Conclusion:
Healthcare data analysis plays a vital role in improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare processes. 
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, offering valuable insights that can inform decision-making in the healthcare domain.
